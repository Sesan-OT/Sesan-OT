Hello there. My name is Oluwasesan Tolulope Ogunbanjo, Sesan for short. 
I am currently working within the rail engineering industry as a civil engineer 
Not too long ago I decide to begin a professional transition into I.T. 
By chance i was introduced by a friend to the cloud and in particular AWS. 
Since then I have immersed myself in learning about AWS and its vast offerings. 

I set up this platform to showcase what I can do on the cloud to potential employers. 
I hope you enjoy what you see !
